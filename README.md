# Learning React.js User Interfaces
The course begins by ensuring you have a solid understanding of Bootstrap and JSX, so you can create React components that can automatically refresh, enabling fully dynamic interfaces. We then introduce ES6 into the mix, showing you how the latest web technologies can be used to make your user interfaces even better. Next, you will see how to integrate and componentize CSS into React using SASS, enabling you to style your components using web standard techniques. Finally, we will dive into animation, and you’ll understand states and events to create reactive user interface components.
